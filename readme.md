```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
cd /home/ubuntu
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/elk-stack.git
cd elk-stack
docker-compose up -d
```

### Example of the elasticsearch.yml

Located at `~/mydockerELK/config/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`:

```yaml
cluster.name: "es-cluster"
node.name: "es-node1"
path.data: /usr/share/elasticsearch/data
path.logs: /usr/share/elasticsearch/logs
network.host: 0.0.0.0
http.port: 9200
discovery.type: single-node
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

### Step 3: Ensure Directories Exist

Verify that the directory structure exists for the Elasticsearch data and configuration files. If the path `./config/elasticsearch` does not exist, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/mydockerELK/config/elasticsearch
```

Make sure the `elasticsearch.yml` file is located in that directory and is not a directory itself.

### Step 4: Restart the Docker Compose

Once everything is set up, restart the services using the updated `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Verify the Status

After starting the services, check if the containers are up and running:

```bash
docker ps
```

Also, check logs to verify that Elasticsearch is running properly:

```bash
docker-compose logs elasticsearch-node1
docker-compose logs kibana
docker-compose logs logstash
```

### Troubleshooting

If you still encounter the error, check the following:

#### File Permissions

Ensure the Elasticsearch config file and directories have the correct read permissions for Docker to mount them:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 ~/mydockerELK/config/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
sudo chmod -R 755 ~/mydockerELK/config/elasticsearch/
```

#### Docker Cache

Sometimes Docker caches old images. Clean up and rebuild:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This should resolve your issue with mounting the `elasticsearch.yml` file and allow you to use ELK 8.16.1 successfully.
